Module 8: Terraform | Day 33 | 24-02-2026
============================================================================================================
Terraform installation
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo dnf -y install terraform
terraform --version

EC2 instances
	variables.tf	- declare the variables
	main.tf		- declare the resource info
	outputs.tf	- declare the outputs
	.tfvars		- declare the values for the variables
		dev-team.tfvars
		test-team.tfvars
		prod-team.tfvars


dev		(t2.micro, 3)
test		(t2.medium, 2)
prod	(t2.large, 1)


=> Creation of VPC
region - ap-south-1
1 VPC - kastro-vpc
2 subnets - kastro-public (public subnet), kastro-private (private subnet)
2 route tables - kastro-public-rt, kastro-private-rt
1 internet gateway - kastro-igw
public subnet connect to IGW via public route table

CIDR - Classless Inter Domain Range - how many IPs you need for the network

=>Terraform Taint - it is used to recreate a specific resource in the existing infra.
To make terraform understand to recreate the resource, we need to mark the resource as tainted

EC2 Instance
S3 bucket

=> Terraform Workspaces

terraform workspace list
terraform workspace new <workspace-name>
terraform workspace show
terraform workspace select <workspace-name>
terraform workspace delete <workspace-name>

=> Creation of EC2 instance with EBS Volume

=> Storing the state file in remote location
in S3 bucket

Task: export the state file from local to remote (s3 bucket)

=> Terraform drift
It happens when the real infra in AWS becomes different from what is defined in your terraform code or state file

=> Multi region resource creation

=> prevent_destroy
we will write a "lifecycle" block - true
