#To delete the cluster
eksctl delete cluster --name kastro-cluster --region ap-south-1


3. Init Containers
These are special containers that run before the main app containers comes to the running state inside a pod
If an init container fails, K8s restarts it until it succeeds 
exit code 0

4. Static Pods
Static Containers are managed by kubelet
DaemonSet is the advanced concept of managing the pods on all worker nodes

/etc/kubernetes/manifests ----> If you keep any manifest file, automatically based on the configurations available in the manifest file the pods will get created

You cannot create static pods on EKS worker nodes, because while working with EKS Cluster, EKS will maintain all the workloads
Static pods can be created when working with self managed clusters

=> Pod Restart Policy;
It defines what K8s should do when a container inside the pod terminates/exits

Always	(default)
OnFailure	- restarts only if the container exits
Never		- never restart the containers

=> K8s Services
Services are used to expose the application running inside a pod to the end users
pod manifest file	---- contains pod information
service manifest file ---- contains info about how to expose your app

Types of Services;
ClusterIP	(default)
NodePort
LoadBalancer
ExternalName (domain mapping)

How a service will identify the pods?
A service will identify the pods by using pod labels
In the pod manifest file we will write "labels" under metadata

selector is used in the service manifest file to go and select the pods with specific labels

ClusterIP is used to access the app within the cluster

2. NodePort
NodePort is a service type that exposes our application to be accessible externally on a static port number on all the nodes in the cluster
static port number range is 30000-32767
It is not mandatory to provide the node port number in the service manifest file. By default, if node port number is given, k8s will allot any random port number with in the above specified range
Open the port in the SG of worker node
PublicIP:NodePort

3. Load Balancer
K8s will integrate with cloud service provider's load balancer

3 types of load balancers;
App LB
Network LB
Gateway LB
Classic LB	- default load balancer

Note: Using Ingress Controller we can decide what type of load balancer we need

DNS of LB ---> Lengthy URL	---> Access App

=> Namespace
Logical isolation of different resources for different teams/apps running the cluster

types of NS;
default				- default - all the resources will get created in the "default" ns
kube-system			- Kubernetes system components - all the cluster related info will run inside this
kube-public			- user info will be there
kube-node-lease		- node heartbeat info

RBAC - Roll Based Access Control

Note: When you delete a namespace, all the resources running inside that namespace will get deleted automatically
